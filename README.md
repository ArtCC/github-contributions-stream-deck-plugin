### 5-Button Year View
To use the extended year view:
1. Set up 5 adjacent buttons on your Stream Deck.
2. Configure each button with the same settings, but assign each a unique button number (1-5).
3. This will create a large, detailed view of your entire year's contributions spread across 5 buttons.
